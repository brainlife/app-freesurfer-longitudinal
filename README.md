# app-freesurfer-longitudinal

This App allows brainlife.io to perform freesurfer longitudinal processing

https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/LongitudinalTutorial

This App can run in 2 modes

## "base" mode

In base mode, this App will receive multiple freesurfer inputs and generate a single "base" template which can be used to run freesurfer longitudinal processing.

## "long" mode.

In long mode, this App will receive a single freesurfer input as well as the template generate from the "base" mode and output freesurfer output that contains longitudinal processing done.
